Rachel Mendez was enjoying her usual Saturday morning coffee at Oakwood Café on 5th Street in Portland. As a freelance graphic designer, she often brought her laptop to work on projects for her clients, balancing her oat milk latte next to her sketchbook. Her phone buzzed with a call from her sister, Olivia, reminding her about their dinner plans at Matteo’s on Hawthorne Avenue. Glancing at her watch—a birthday gift from her parents last year—she made a note to wrap up her work before heading home to her apartment at 1438 Linden Drive.
