Action Plan â€“ Situation Information
<|Zinet|> is {20} years old and currently lives at <| youth apartment Rikshem |>, but will need to find her own apartment later on.
She currently receives {CSN} funding but wants to start working part-time while studying, preferably in an office setting, such as administration.
<|Zinet|> attends adult education ({Komvux}) and primarily wants support regarding housing, though she sometimes struggles with motivation for school and organizing her daily routine. <|Daniela|> will participate in meetings with the school. <|Zinet|> potentially has <|ADHD|>; she has visited a doctor and an evaluation is ongoing, but no diagnosis has yet been confirmed. <|Daniela|> will follow up on this matter. <|Zinet|> currently receives homework assistance at school but has limited support for planning her studies. We have coordinated with the school so we can provide various types of assistance.
The following plan is in place:
<|Erika|> will assist and support with planning and school-related tasks, while <|Daniela|> will assist and support with job searching, housing, and health-related matters. <|Zinet|>, <|Daniela|>, and <|Erika|> will work together toward the goal of achieving independence, with the eventual objective that <|Zinet|> will independently manage contacts with healthcare providers, the school, housing authorities, etc.
