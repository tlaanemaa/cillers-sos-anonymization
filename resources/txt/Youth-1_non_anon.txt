To Emma/Sara:
Samuel requested to meet with a support person regularly, at least once every two weeks, and that he is open to receiving support in multiple areas of life; I mentioned that I think he has already made considerable progress. He said that he can imagine that additional issues may arise that he would like help with, beyond what has been mentioned above. So I think we start with a support person and then see how his needs develop. I also mentioned the option of using us coordinators for one-off interventions, a couple of sessions until he feels satisfied, but he insists that he needs long-term support with a dedicated support person. He himself suggested meeting with one of you for job search when I am away if we cannot match him with a support person right now.
What we did during our meeting was:
Parts of the baseline assessment + the above conversation
Clarified some aspects regarding booking healthcare and rehabilitation, and called the driving school
Looked into some cafés where he wants to work, registered him there, and went over what he needs to consider further before potentially starting work there (he prefers working in a café rather than fast-food restaurants)
